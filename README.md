Project BetterBatch is a collection of useful batch plugins.

The batch plugins:

1. mconst.bat - Math constants for batch, view code for more details
2. math.bat - Floating-point operations in batch, requires Python interpreter
3. svtocmd.bat - Allows you to set a variable to the output of a command.
      Usage: svtocmd [variable] = "[command]"

More batch plugins will be added soon.
